description: >- # dont remove this line. this will ignore all new lines until the next section
 I am a student at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), currently pursuing a degree in Robotics Systems Engineering (RSE). 
 Throughout my studies, I have gained practical and theoretical knowledge in systems engineering, the Robot Operating System (ROS), as well as programming in Python and C++.
 My experience with ROS 1 (Melodic) includes working with the navigation stack, motion planning, SLAM, and robot simulation. 
 I aim to develop intelligent and reliable robotic solutions that meet real-world operational needs. This e-portfolio showcases my learning journey and the projects where I apply these skills in practice.
