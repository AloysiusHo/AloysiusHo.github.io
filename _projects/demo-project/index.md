title: Systems Engineering Project 1
description:  
  This project involves implementing a robotic system using the LIMO robot platform, ROS1 (Melodic) Navigation Stack, and RTAB-Map for real-time mapping. As part of the development, we designed a 1.33m x 1.5m Changi Airport-themed arena and programmed the robot to autonomously navigate not only within our own arena but also across arenas built by other teams. Using RTAB-Map, the robot was able to generate real-time maps of both familiar and unfamiliar environments to support autonomous navigation.

# Problem Definition
We were tasked with designing a robotic system capable of autonomous navigation in diverse environments. The primary challenge was to ensure that our robot could successfully navigate our custom-built arena and adapt its behavior to operate effectively in  arenas designed by other teams.
## Requirements 
The goal is to autonomously reach the center of the assigned plot from the initial position by following the most efficient route.



## Arena: Canopy Park
The theme of the arena is based on Canopy Park, a featured attraction at Changi Airport.
