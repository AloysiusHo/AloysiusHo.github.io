title: Systems Engineering Project 1
description:  
  This project applies the Systems Approach from the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) to design, develop, and implement a robotic system using the     LIMO robot platform and ROS 1 Melodic. As part of the project, we designed a 1.33m x 1.5m changi airport related arena and programmed the robot with ROS1(Melodic) to autonomously navigate not only our own themed arena, but also adapt to and operate in arenas built by other teams.

# Problem Definition
We were tasked with designing a robotic system capable of autonomous navigation in diverse environments. The primary challenge was to ensure that our robot could successfully navigate our custom-built arena and adapt its behavior to operate effectively in  arenas designed by other teams.
## Requirements 
The goal is to autonomously reach the center of the assigned plot from the initial position by following the most efficient route.



## Arena: Canopy Park
The theme of the arena is based on Canopy Park, a featured attraction at Changi Airport.
