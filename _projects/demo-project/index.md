title: Systems Engineering Project 1
description:  
  This project applies the Systems Approach from the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) to design, develop, and implement a robotic system using the     LIMO robot platform and ROS 1 Melodic. As part of the project, we designed a 1.33m x 1.5m changi airport related arena and programmed the robot with ROS1(Melodic) to autonomously navigate not only our own themed arena, but also adapt to and operate in arenas built by other teams.

# Problem Definition
We were tasked with designing a robotic system capable of autonomous navigation in diverse environments. The primary challenge was to ensure that our robot could successfully navigate our custom-built arena and adapt its behavior to operate effectively in  arenas designed by other teams.
## Requirements 
The goal is to autonomously reach the center of the assigned plot from the initial position by following the most efficient route.



## Arena 
### Canopy Park

You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  


## Demonstration
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
